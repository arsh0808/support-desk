# Support Desk – MERN Stack Project

## 📌 Project Overview
Support Desk is a full-stack web application built to manage customer support tickets.  
Users can register, log in, create support tickets, and track their status, while the backend securely stores and manages all data.

This project is developed as part of my **BCA curriculum** and demonstrates practical implementation of the **MERN stack**.
